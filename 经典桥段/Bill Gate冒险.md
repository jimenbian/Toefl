What are the advantages of taking chances? Firstly, whether it is positive or not, it would mark a turnabout in one's career. Bill Gates, the most typical example of a person who gain massive success, had grades well above sufficient to go to Harvard Law school, but refuse to. Instead, he delicated his whole career to developing and improving software and computers. At his time, nobody had anticipated that computers would ever reach their full potential, therefore, making Gate's career choice highly risky. Taking risks could be a dangerous gamble, but it is the price we have to pay for success.
