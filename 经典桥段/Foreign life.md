Foreign life can serve various life experience and lifestyles which are hardly acquired in domestic life. In the identical social and environmental circumstance, people generally have relatively familiar and similar views and experience. The distinction is, if any, slight. If people do not go aboard, they can rarely obtain the refreshing ideas. For example, some people who come from highly industrialized countries with high welfare, tend to take the free healthcare and education for granted, but if they have a foreign tour in impoverished countries or regions where the food is almost far from enough, not to mention schooling, they can get a precious lesson: Cherish one's own life and help someone who need help.
