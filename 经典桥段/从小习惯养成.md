habits, formed at the early age are extremely stable. There is an Nobel gainer said that kindergarten is the most significant stage in his life. At kindergarten, he learned wash hands before eating; keep quiet at class; be polite with each other. He remember all these good habits through his whole life. I means if children learn how to manage their money at a young age. They will remember these principles all their life.
