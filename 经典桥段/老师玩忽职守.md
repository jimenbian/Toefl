Lastly, in fact, some teachers are indeed not qualified for the job. On the one hand, teachers are the very people who should help and comfort all students whenever students need them. However, some teachers don't shoulder the responsibility to take care of each student. They just place their emphasis on those students who are smart or whose family is powerful. On the other hand, some teachers ignore the importance of academic ethics. In order to earn profits, some of them make fake data in their experimental data, or copy others articles without quotes. All of these phenomena lower the statue of teachers and harm their fames.
