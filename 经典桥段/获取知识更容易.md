To some extent, most of the past generation's knowledge derived from their teachers' lectures and limited textbooks. In stark contrast, currently, not only can students have access to infinite references, from liberal arts to engineering, but also, they are able to enjoy the convenience of modern technology. For instance, when facing complicated chemical reactions or abstract concepts, they can just click their mouse, utilize Google, Wiki, or even campus BBS to help them find accurate solutions.
