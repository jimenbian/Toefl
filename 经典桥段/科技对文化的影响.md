Nevertheless, to some extent, the technology also exert favorable detrimental impact on our society in terms of culture. The advancement in technology makes it possible the globalization of culture and economy, which, ultimately, leads to erosion of our national pride and social fabric. For instance, in China, people, especially adolescents, increasingly pay excessive attention to the latest blockbuster of Hollywood, the fancy clothes in Paris, or the hip-hop songs of Lady Gaga. Apparently, owing to the globalization brought by technology and science, we Chinese are losing our invaluable and vulnerable cultural heritage and cherished traditions. Ironically, the technology, once anticipated to preserve and improve our culture and custom, ultimately, restricts the development and protection of our own culture, resulting in an intricate dilemma that no one is able to tackle.
